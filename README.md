# Simple-Shopping-List
This a simple shopping list created to understand DOM Manipulation.

In this exercise we were given the task of coding a simple shopping list. The code consist of a simple form with an input value that will save each list item and append it to the already created ul at the same time that it creates a new button that allow us to delet a single list item. I decided to add a third button after the "Add item" button which can delete ALL the items in the list at once. I also wanted to style it a bit since as a designer I feel like it is a very important part of the whole work even though right now Im focusing on understandig Javascript better.

CONCLUSION

This comes from the Basic DOM Manipulation article from Mozilla Developer Network, which we were sent to after completing the "Loops adn Iteration" section of the frontend developer guide. This list helped me to comprehend better the way we can manipulate the Document Object Model by using query selectors to determine and define HTML elements aswell as creating, deleting, or editing them. It also teached me how funcionality works inside the web by implementing Javascript code to generate new interactions with the page, the nodes and its "childs" or "family members". I keep learning at my own slow pace and cant really believe how we got this far.
